About
============
This module is very useful to manage important documents of the customer. It helps to send email notifications to customers for document expiration. You can send notifications before/after the expiry date as well as when the document expires. We provide a multiple email feature that helps to send email notifications to multiple employees at a time. You can see the document without download using the document smart button. This module allows sending the notification using scheduled action or manually. cheers!
